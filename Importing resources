# Importing resources from AWS to terraform
Let's say I have already had Ec2 instance running on AWS
create a terraform main.tf file and
provider"aws"{
  region = "us-east-1"
}

import {
 id = "aws_instance_id"

to = aws_instance.example
}
and then terraform init
```
terraform plan -generate-config-out=generated_resources.tf
```
A generated file is created and now copy the entire resource from the resources field to the bottom and in the main.tf delete the import block and generated file
, and paste the resources from the generated files.
remove the ipv6 configure fields

```
terraform plan  
```
but Terraform doesn't know because the state file is still missing
```
terraform import aws_instance.example i-0423979eb3b48985c
```
